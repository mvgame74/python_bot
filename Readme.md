This is my first bot in Python:

1. We created an account for a bot in Telegram, using "BotFather", which requested a bot name and a username, and it produced a Key that we could use to access the bot

2. We install the package for the Telegram bot (github https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI)

3. We used such key to create our API_KEY (usually in and .env, but in this case replit created a locked file to store it)

4. We created a connection and added a couple of simple methods to confirm the bot was working correctly

4.
